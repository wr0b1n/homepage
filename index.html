                <h3>C# .NET Development</h3>
                <p>I first came in touch with C# and .NET during my bachelor thesis. After graduating I worked my way
                    through many more projects and gathered a lot of practical experience. Over the last years I also
                    worked with WPF and WCF techniques as well as SQL databases in combination with the .NET Framwork.

                <h3>Web Developement</h3>
                <p>Thanks to schoolings during my work time I made my first steps in the area of web development. At the
                    moment this is more a hobby for me than a professional thing. But I am always exited to learn new
                    skills and techniques. This was the reason why I dived right into the topic during my freetime and
                    created this homepage by myself.</p>
